Class 10th Gravitation
What is Gravitation?, Gravitation is the force that pulls objects with mass towards each other.
Who discover gravitation?, Sir Isaac Newton
Book name in which Newton gave theory of gravity?, Principia
Which new branch of mathematics invented by Newton?, Calculus
Who invented first reflecting telescope?, Sir Isaac Newton
What is circular motion?, Any object moves in circular path is called as circular motion.
What is centripetal force?, A force acting on an object moving in a circle and it is directed towards its centre along with radius is called centripetal force
Centripetal means?, Centre seeking
Example of centripetal force, i)Moon revolve around sun ii)The Earth rotating around sun.
Formula of centripetal force?, F =MxV/R²
Which scientist gave law of planetary motion?, Johannes Kepler
What is Kepler first law?, The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci.
What is Kepler second law?, The line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time.
What is Kepler third law?, T^2 \propto r^3
What is limitation of Kepler laws?, He had no explanation as to why planets obey these laws.
What is Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation?, Every object in the Universe attracts every other object with a definite force. This force is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. F = GxM1xM2/D²
What is universal gravitational constant?, G is universal gravitational constant whose value is 6.673 x 10^-11 N M²/Kg²
Which scientist measures the experimental value of G?, Henry Canvendish
If the mass of a body increases by factor of 2 then force on them will be?, Increase by 4 times
If the mass of a body decreases by factor of 2 then force on them will be?, Decreases by 4 times
If the distance between body is increase by 2 times then force on them will be?, Decrease by 4 times
If the distance between body is decrease by 2 times then force on them will be?, Increase by 4 times
If the mass of objects increase by 3 times then force between them?, Increase by 9 times
From where the distance between two objects taken if they are spherical?, From there centre
From where the distance between two objects taken if they are not spherical?, From there centre of mass
What is centre of mass?, The centre of mass of an object is the point inside or outside the object at which the total mass of the object can be assumed to be concentrated.
